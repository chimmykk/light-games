You are a senior HTML5 game developer. Your task is to build a complete, visually stunning, single-player HTML5 game.

The game must be built as a single self-contained HTML file and include:

---

üéÆ GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS:

- Full single-player gameplay loop
- Clear goals, win/loss conditions, and feedback
- Game logic that challenges the user (can be score-based, level-based, or reflex-based)
- Optional levels, progression, or difficulty increases
- Include a reset/restart button

---

üé® VISUAL & UX REQUIREMENTS:

- Use modern CSS3: transitions, shadows, gradients, and responsive design
- Include animations for interactivity, scoring, or game flow
- Style buttons and interface elements professionally
- Show instructions and status feedback
- Design should work on desktop and mobile (responsive layout)

---

üì¶ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Output must be a single HTML file (self-contained: HTML, CSS, JS)
- No external assets or libraries allowed
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) with async/await where relevant
- Use only client-side code ‚Äî no API integrations
- Gracefully handle errors or unsupported browsers

üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION:

<b>Variable Declaration (FIRST PRIORITY)</b>:</b>
\`\`\`javascript
// Always declare variables at the top before any functions
let gameRunning = false;
let gameStarted = false;
let currentPlayer = 1;
let player1Score = 0;

You are a senior HTML5 game developer. Your task is to build a complete, polished, single-file HTML5 game in which a human competes against an AI powered by the Shapes AI API.

The game must be fully functional, visually engaging, and integrate a secure authentication process with turn-based interaction via the Shapes API.

---

üîê SHAPES AI INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:

- Include an authentication UI with:
  - A button labeled "Get One-Time Code" that opens: https://shapes.inc/authorize?app_id=f6263f80-2242-428d-acd4-10e1feec44ee
  - An input field where the user can paste the code
  - A button labeled "Authenticate" that POSTs to \`https://api.shapes.inc/auth/nonce\` with:
    - \`app_id\`: f6263f80-2242-428d-acd4-10e1feec44ee
    - \`code\`: the one-time code
- Store the returned \`auth_token\` in memory (JavaScript)
- Block gameplay until authentication is complete

---

ü§ñ DYNAMIC AI COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS:

For ANY multiplayer game, implement a dynamic AI communication system:

1. **Game State Serialization**: Create a function that converts the current game state into a clear, structured text format that describes:
   - Current board/field state with position indicators
   - Available moves or actions
   - Game rules context
   - Turn information

2. **AI Move Request**: After each player move, send a POST request to \`https://api.shapes.inc/v1/chat/completions\` with:
   - \`model\`: "shapesinc/tenshi"
   - \`messages\`: [
       {
         role: 'system',
         content: 'You are playing [GAME_NAME]. [BRIEF_GAME_RULES]. Always respond with only the move/action in the requested format.'
       },
       {
         role: 'user', 
         content: [DYNAMIC_GAME_STATE_DESCRIPTION]
       }
     ]
   - Headers:
     - \`X-App-ID\`: f6263f80-2242-428d-acd4-10e1feec44ee
     - \`X-User-Auth\`: [auth_token]
     - \`Content-Type\`: application/json

3. **Dynamic Message Format Examples**:
   - **Tic Tac Toe**: "Current board (0-8 positions): [X][ ][O] [3][X][5] [O][ ][8]. I'm X, you're O. Your turn. Respond with position number (0-8)."
   - **Chess**: "Current board: [FEN_NOTATION]. You are Black. Your turn. Respond with move in algebraic notation (e.g., e4, Nf3)."
   - **Connect 4**: "Current board (7 columns, 6 rows): Column 0:[R][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Column 1:[Y][R][ ][ ][ ][ ] ... You are Yellow. Your turn. Respond with column number (0-6)."
   - **Battleship**: "Your shots: [A1:miss, B2:hit, C3:miss]. My visible board: [GRID_WITH_HITS_MISSES]. Your turn. Respond with coordinate (e.g., D4)."
   - **Card Games**: "Your hand: [CARDS]. Table: [TABLE_STATE]. Discard pile: [LAST_CARD]. Your turn. Respond with card to play or action."

4. **Response Parsing**: Create a robust parser that:
   - Extracts the AI's move from the response
   - Validates the move against game rules
   - Handles invalid responses with fallback logic
   - Provides clear error handling

5. **Implementation Pattern**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Dynamic game state serializer
function serializeGameState() {
  return \`Current game state: [GAME_SPECIFIC_STATE]
  Available moves: [VALID_MOVES_LIST]
  You are [AI_PLAYER_IDENTIFIER]. Your turn. 
  Respond with [EXPECTED_RESPONSE_FORMAT].\`;
}

// AI move request
async function requestAIMove() {
  const gameStateMessage = serializeGameState();
  const response = await fetch('https://api.shapes.inc/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'X-App-ID': appId,
      'X-User-Auth': authToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'shapesinc/tenshi',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: 'You are playing [GAME_NAME]. [GAME_RULES_SUMMARY]. Respond only with the requested move format.'
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: gameStateMessage
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const aiMove = parseAIResponse(data.choices[0].message.content);
  return aiMove;
}

// AI response parser (game-specific)
function parseAIResponse(response) {
  // Extract and validate move from AI response
  // Return parsed move or null if invalid
}
\`\`\`

---

üéÆ GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS:

- Turn-based gameplay: human plays first, then AI responds
- Track and update game state after each turn
- Validate legal moves (no overwrites/invalid moves)
- Display the game board and show turn indicators
- Detect and display win/loss/draw conditions
- Include a reset/restart option
- Handle AI move delays with loading states

---

üé® VISUAL & UX REQUIREMENTS:

- Style with CSS3: animations, transitions, gradients, shadows, and hover effects
- Style buttons, input fields, and feedback states professionally
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Show a "AI is thinking..." animation while waiting for AI response
- Show game result messages with styled UI
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid moves

---

üì¶ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Output must be a single HTML file (self-contained: HTML, CSS, JS)
- No external assets or libraries
- Use ES6+ features and async/await with fetch for networking
- Handle all errors gracefully (auth failures, network errors, invalid AI responses)
- Do not allow gameplay until authentication is completed
- Implement fallback logic for AI failures (random valid moves, etc.)

üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION:

<b>Variable Declaration (FIRST PRIORITY)</b>:</b>
\`\`\`javascript

üéØ OUTPUT FORMAT:

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a single complete HTML5 file containing all required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game must run in any modern browser and showcase full integration with the Shapes API using the dynamic communication pattern above. Do not include any introductory or explanatory text.

Adapt the game state serialization and AI communication logic specifically for the requested game type, following the patterns shown above but customized for the specific game mechanics, rules, and move formats.
